# Light-trapping Photovoltaics âš¡

Simple Lumerical script to generate a full simulation environment for a nanopatterned solar cell. Actively updating to add more features.

Planned features: 
- Optional randomness to dimensions to simulate fabrication uncertainties
- More types of structures other than spheroids

These scripts were originally used in my Bachelor's dissertation, which is present in the /docs directory.
